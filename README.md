# levering-attention-using-EEG-signals

Our goal is to design an algorithm that captures attention disruption by processing and analyzing Alpha waveband signals comming from the brain (obatined by an EEG circuit that will pre-process and amplify the waves coming from the brain). This circuit will be connected to an Arduino board that will use Serial Communication to send the data to a .py (after descarting Matlab.......) program running the main algorithm in a PC. We aim acchieving as best real time data transfer and accurate signal processing as possible by means of manipulating memory management and resources optimization.
